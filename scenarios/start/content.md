# The Crossroads

You stand at a weathered crossroads as the afternoon sun casts long shadows across the dirt path. A wooden signpost, its paint long faded, points in three directions.

To the west, smoke rises from chimneys—the village of Millbrook and its infamous tavern, The Rusty Nail. To the east, the dark treeline of Thornwood Forest looms, full of whispered dangers and forgotten treasures.

The wind carries the faint sound of laughter from the village, mingled with birdsong from the forest edge.

What calls to you?
