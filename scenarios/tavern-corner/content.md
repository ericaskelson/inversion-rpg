# The Quiet Corner

You claim a table in the shadows, back to the wall, watching the room. Old habits.

From here you can see everything—the merchants finalizing their deal with a handshake, Marta slipping something to the hooded figure along with their drink, and the drunk finally collapsing into a chair near the fire.

A serving girl brings you an ale without being asked. "You look like you needed one," she says with a knowing smile.

The evening passes peacefully. Sometimes the best adventures are the ones you don't have.
