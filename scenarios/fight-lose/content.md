# Knocked Down

The drunk's fist catches you square in the temple. Stars explode across your vision and the floor rushes up to meet you.

You come to moments later—or maybe minutes—with Marta standing over you, a bucket of cold water dripping from your face.

"Out," she says flatly. "Both of you. I don't care who started it."

You stumble into the evening air, pride bruised worse than your face. The drunk is already snoring against the tavern wall.

Tomorrow is another day. Hopefully one with fewer fists.
