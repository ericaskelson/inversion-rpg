# The Secret Way

Your keen eye catches it—the signpost doesn't quite sit right. One of the directional signs can pivot, and beneath it, worn runes are carved into the wood.

You rotate the sign, and the air shimmers. A fourth path reveals itself, one that wasn't there before, leading neither to village nor forest but somewhere... else.

The path is paved with stones that glow faintly in the fading light. Wherever this leads, it's not on any map.

With a smile, you step forward. Adventure, it seems, was waiting for you to notice it.
