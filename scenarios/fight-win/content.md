Your fist connects solidly with his jaw. The drunk's eyes roll back and he crumples like a puppet with cut strings, unconscious before he hits the sawdust floor.

The tavern erupts in cheers—or at least, the part of it that bet on you does. Marta looks at you with newfound respect, sliding a fresh ale across the bar.

"On the house. Anyone who can shut Gorm up with one punch drinks free tonight."

You've made a name for yourself in Millbrook. Whether that's a good thing remains to be seen.
