# The Rusty Nail

You push open the heavy oak door and step into The Rusty Nail. The tavern is surprisingly busy for this hour—farmers nursing ales after a long day, a group of merchants arguing over prices, and in the corner, a hooded figure who definitely isn't watching you.

The bar is tended by a heavyset woman with forearms like ham hocks, polishing a glass with practiced indifference. A fire crackles in the hearth, and the smell of stew fills the air.

A drunk patron stumbles near the entrance, not quite blocking your path but clearly unstable.
