# Thornwood's Edge

The forest swallows you whole. Within a dozen steps, the sounds of the village fade to nothing, replaced by rustling leaves and distant birdcall.

The path is overgrown but passable. Shafts of golden light pierce the canopy, illuminating dancing motes of pollen—or something more magical.

You walk until dusk, finding nothing but peace and the strange contentment of solitude. Sometimes the journey itself is the destination.

As night falls, you make camp beneath an ancient oak. Tomorrow, the path continues.
