# At the Bar

You settle onto a worn wooden stool. The barkeep—Marta, according to the regulars—slides over without a word, one eyebrow raised in question.

"Ale, mead, or something stronger?" Her voice is gravel and smoke. "We've also got stew if you've got coin and an iron stomach."

Before you can answer, the drunk from the entrance staggers over and slams into your shoulder, sloshing his drink across the bar.

"Hey! You're in my spot!" he slurs, though you're quite certain there are a dozen empty stools.
